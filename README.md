# ⚖️ Obesity Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project explores the development of machine learning models to assess the **risk of obesity and obesity-related diseases** based on clinical and behavioral data. The system leverages predictive modeling to enable **early risk detection**, offering valuable insights for preventive healthcare, personalized wellness, and public health interventions.

---

## 🧭 Objective

To build a reliable AI-based system that can predict obesity risk levels (e.g., normal, overweight, obese) using structured patient data such as age, physical activity, dietary habits, and other health indicators. The models are optimized to support **clinical decisions**, **fitness programs**, and **digital health apps**.

---

## 🩺 Domain Significance

Obesity is a globally recognized health crisis, contributing to severe conditions like **type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, liver dysfunction,** and even **certain cancers**. Timely intervention through data-driven risk stratification can significantly reduce healthcare burdens and improve quality of life.
